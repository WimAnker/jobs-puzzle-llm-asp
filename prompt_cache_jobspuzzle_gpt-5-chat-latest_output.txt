Excellent — you’ve already reasoned through the structure.  
Now let’s write the **ASP rules** for **Problem 2**, following the same pattern as in Problem 1.

---

### Task 1.  Represent each category of constants

We write one rule per category, listing all constants separated by semicolons:

```prolog
person("Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete").
job("chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer").     
gender("male"; "female").
```

---

### Task 2.  Write rules for each predicate

We have two predicates:

1. `holds(Person, Job)` — each person holds exactly two jobs.
2. `has_gender(Person, Gender)` — each person has exactly one gender.

Following the required pattern
`{predicate(X₁,…,Xₙ): category₂(X₂),…,categoryₙ(Xₙ)}=k :- category₁(X₁).`

---

#### (a)  Each person holds exactly two jobs

```prolog
{holds(P, J): job(J)} = 2 :- person(P).
```

#### (b)  Each person has exactly one gender

```prolog
{has_gender(P, G): gender(G)} = 1 :- person(P).
```

---

✅ **Final ASP Rules for Problem 2**

```prolog
% --- Task 1: Define constants in each category ---
person("Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete").
job("chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer").     
gender("male"; "female").

% --- Task 2: Define predicate rules ---
% Each person holds exactly two jobs.
{holds(P, J): job(J)} = 2 :- person(P).

% Each person has exactly one gender.
{has_gender(P, G): gender(G)} = 1 :- person(P).
```

These rules complete Tasks 1 and 2 for Problem 2 in the same style as the example from Problem 1.       

Excellent — now that we have the predicates, we can translate each clue into formal constraints, just as in the earlier problems.

## Problem 3 Constraints

### Predicates
```prolog
% The categories in Constants include person, job, and gender.
% We use different variables P, J, and G to represent person, job, and gender.

% Predicate 1: A person P holds a job J.
holds(P, J)

% Predicate 2: A person P has a gender G.
has_gender(P, G)
```

---

### Constraints

#### 1. Each person holds exactly two jobs.
```prolog
{J="chef"; J="guard"; J="nurse"; J="telephone operator"; J="police officer"; J="teacher"; J="actor"; J="boxer"}=2 :- holds(P,J).
```

#### 2. The same job cannot be assigned to different people.
```prolog
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1,J), holds(P2,J), P1 != P2.
```

#### 3. Each person has exactly one gender.
```prolog
{G="male"; G="female"}=1 :- has_gender(P,G).
```

#### 4. The job of nurse is held by a male.
```prolog
G="male" :- holds(P,"nurse"), has_gender(P,G).
```

#### 5. The husband of the chef is the telephone operator.
- The chef is female.
- The telephone operator is male.
- They are different people.
```prolog
G1="female" :- holds(P1,"chef"), has_gender(P1,G1).
G2="male" :- holds(P2,"telephone operator"), has_gender(P2,G2).
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1,"chef"), holds(P2,"telephone operator").
```

#### 6. Roberta is not a boxer.
```prolog
J != "boxer" :- holds("Roberta",J).
```

#### 7. Pete has no education past the ninth grade.
(He cannot hold teacher, nurse, or police officer.)
```prolog
{J="teacher"; J="nurse"; J="police officer"}=0 :- holds("Pete",J).
```

#### 8. Roberta, the chef, and the police officer went golfing together (so they are different people). 
```prolog
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1,"chef"), holds(P2,"police officer").
P1 != "Roberta" :- holds(P1,"chef").
P2 != "Roberta" :- holds(P2,"police officer").
```

#### 9. Gender facts (given directly):
```prolog
has_gender("Roberta","female").
has_gender("Thelma","female").
has_gender("Steve","male").
has_gender("Pete","male").
```

#### 10. The actor is a male.
```prolog
G="male" :- holds(P,"actor"), has_gender(P,G).
```

✅ **Final Set of Constraints**

```prolog
% 1. Each person holds exactly two jobs.
{J="chef"; J="guard"; J="nurse"; J="telephone operator"; J="police officer"; J="teacher"; J="actor"; J="boxer"}=2 :- holds(P,J).

% 2. The same job cannot be assigned to different people.
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1,J), holds(P2,J), P1 != P2.

% 3. Each person has exactly one gender.
{G="male"; G="female"}=1 :- has_gender(P,G).

% 4. The job of nurse is held by a male.
G="male" :- holds(P,"nurse"), has_gender(P,G).

% 5. The husband of the chef is the telephone operator.
G1="female" :- holds(P1,"chef"), has_gender(P1,G1).
G2="male" :- holds(P2,"telephone operator"), has_gender(P2,G2).
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1,"chef"), holds(P2,"telephone operator").

% 6. Roberta is not a boxer.
J != "boxer" :- holds("Roberta",J).

% 7. Pete cannot hold teacher, nurse, or police officer.
{J="teacher"; J="nurse"; J="police officer"}=0 :- holds("Pete",J).

% 8. Roberta, the chef, and the police officer are different people.
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1,"chef"), holds(P2,"police officer").
P1 != "Roberta" :- holds(P1,"chef").
P2 != "Roberta" :- holds(P2,"police officer").

% 9. Gender facts.
has_gender("Roberta","female").
has_gender("Thelma","female").
has_gender("Steve","male").
has_gender("Pete","male").

% 10. The actor is a male.
G="male" :- holds(P,"actor"), has_gender(P,G).
```

These constraints fully capture all the logical relationships and restrictions described in **Problem 3** using only the provided constants and predicates.
