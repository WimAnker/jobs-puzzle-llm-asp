Let's answer step by step according to your instructions, for **Problem 2: "Against the Grain"**, and **Problem 3 (Job Assignment)** as described:

---

## Problem 2: "Against the Grain"

### **Task 1: Categorized Constants as Rules**

1. **employee: "Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha".**

   ```prolog
   employee("Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha").
   ```

2. **price: 225; 275; 325.**

   ```prolog
   price(225; 275; 325).
   ```

3. **wood_type: "ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood".**

   ```prolog
   wood_type("ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood").
   ```

---

### **Task 2: Predicate as Rule**

Predicate given:
```prolog
% For each employee E, it matches with exactly 1 price P and wood type W.
{match(E, P, W): price(P), wood_type(W)}=1 :- employee(E).
```

This fits your rule form:
```
{predicate(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) : category_2(X_2), ..., category_n(X_n)}=k :- category_1(X_1)
```
- So, for each `employee` E, the set `{match(E, P, W): price(P), wood_type(W)}` assigns **exactly one** price and wood combination.

---

## Problem 3: Jobs Puzzle

### **Task 1: Categorized Constants as Rules**

1. **person: "Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete".**

   ```prolog
   person("Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete").
   ```

2. **job: "chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer".**

   ```prolog
   job("chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer").  
   ```

---

### **Task 2: Predicate as Rule**

Relation: A person holds a job.

Form:
```
{predicate(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n): category_2(X_2), ..., category_n(X_n)}=k :- category_1(X_1)
```
Here, for each **person** P, assign exactly 2 jobs (since each holds two jobs):

```prolog
{holds(P, J): job(J)}=2 :- person(P).
```

If you'd like a "job-centric" alternative (each job is assigned to exactly one person):

```prolog
{holds(P, J): person(P)}=1 :- job(J).
```

---

## **Summary**

### **Problem 2: "Against the Grain"**

**Constants:**
```prolog
employee("Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha").
price(225; 275; 325).
wood_type("ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood").
```
**Predicate Rule:**
```prolog
{match(E, P, W): price(P), wood_type(W)}=1 :- employee(E).
```

---

### **Problem 3: Jobs Puzzle**

**Constants:**
```prolog
person("Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete").
job("chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer").     
```
**Predicate Rule:**
```prolog
{holds(P, J): job(J)}=2 :- person(P).
```
(And/or)
```prolog
{holds(P, J): person(P)}=1 :- job(J).
```

---

**Done!**

Let me know if you need the same for Problem 1 or more details!

Absolutely! Let's **extract the constraints from the text, using only the provided constants and predicates**, for **Problem 3** ("Roberta, Thelma, Steve, Pete" and the 8 jobs), as you requested. We use:     

**Predicates:**
```prolog
holds(P, J)
```
Where P ∈ {“Roberta", "Thelma", "Steve", "Pete"}, 
        J ∈ {“chef", "guard", "nurse", "telephone operator", "police officer", "teacher", "actor", "boxer"}

---

## Constraints for Problem 3

### 1. Each person holds **exactly two different jobs**.
```prolog
{J1 != J2}=1 :- holds(P, J1), holds(P, J2), J1 != J2.
% But we must ensure **exactly two** jobs per person; so:
{holds(P,J): job(J)} = 2 :- person(P).
```

### 2. Each job is assigned to **exactly one person**.
```prolog
{holds(P, J): person(P)} = 1 :- job(J).
```

### 3. The **nurse is a male**.
- Steve or Pete (the only males) hold nurse:
```prolog
{P="Steve"; P="Pete"} = 1 :- holds(P, "nurse").
```
(or, equivalently: `P!="Roberta", P!="Thelma" :- holds(P,"nurse").`)

### 4. The **chef is a female** and her "husband" (must be male) is the telephone operator.
- Chef: must be female (Roberta, Thelma)
- Telephone operator: must be male (Steve, Pete)
- They are married ⇒ chef and telephone operator held by different-gender people:
```prolog
{P="Roberta"; P="Thelma"} = 1 :- holds(P, "chef").
{P="Steve"; P="Pete"} = 1 :- holds(P, "telephone operator").
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1, "chef"), holds(P2, "telephone operator").
```

### 5. **Roberta is not a boxer**
```prolog
P != "Roberta" :- holds(P, "boxer").
```

### 6. Pete cannot be **teacher, nurse, or police officer** (he lacks sufficient education).
```prolog
P != "Pete" :- holds(P, J), J = "teacher".
P != "Pete" :- holds(P, J), J = "nurse".
P != "Pete" :- holds(P, J), J = "police officer".
```
Or, grouped:
```prolog
{J = "teacher"; J = "nurse"; J = "police officer"} = 0 :- holds("Pete", J).
```

### 7. **Roberta, the chef, and the police officer are all different people.**
```prolog
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1, "chef"), holds(P2, "police officer").
P1 != "Roberta" :- holds(P1, "chef").
P2 != "Roberta" :- holds(P2, "police officer").
```
Or, more canonically:
```prolog
AllDifferent(P1, P2, "Roberta") :- holds(P1, "chef"), holds(P2, "police officer").
```

### 8. **Gender assignments for persons and for jobs**
Given in the constants:
"Roberta" and "Thelma": female
"Steve" and "Pete": male
Actor is a male's job:
```prolog
{P="Steve"; P="Pete"} = 1 :- holds(P, "actor").
```
Or, more generally, if the genders were not obvious, we could encode the mapping and refer.
---

### **Full Constraints Extracted** (in list form):

```prolog
% 1. Each person holds exactly two (different) jobs
{holds(P,J): job(J)} = 2 :- person(P).

% 2. Each job is assigned to exactly one person
{holds(P,J): person(P)} = 1 :- job(J).

% 3. The nurse is a male
{P="Steve"; P="Pete"} = 1 :- holds(P, "nurse").

% 4. Chef is a female, telephone operator is a male, and they are different people
{P="Roberta"; P="Thelma"} = 1 :- holds(P, "chef").
{P="Steve"; P="Pete"} = 1 :- holds(P, "telephone operator").
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1, "chef"), holds(P2, "telephone operator").

% 5. Roberta is not a boxer
P != "Roberta" :- holds(P, "boxer").

% 6. Pete cannot be teacher, nurse, or police officer
{J = "teacher"; J = "nurse"; J = "police officer"} = 0 :- holds("Pete", J).

% 7. Roberta, the chef, and the police officer are all different people
P1 != "Roberta" :- holds(P1, "chef").
P2 != "Roberta" :- holds(P2, "police officer").
P1 != P2 :- holds(P1, "chef"), holds(P2, "police officer").

% 8. The actor is a male
{P="Steve"; P="Pete"} = 1 :- holds(P, "actor").
```

Below is the conversion of the provided **Problem 1** and **Problem 2** constants and predicates into ASP rules following your tasks.

---

## Problem 1

### Task 1: Rules of the form
`category(constant_1; constant_2; ...; constant_n).`

```prolog
employee("Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha").
price(225; 275; 325).
wood_type("ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood").
```

### Task 2: For the predicate
```prolog
{match(E, P, W) : price(P), wood_type(W)}=1 :- employee(E).
```
This states: For each employee E, exactly one price P and one wood W is matched.

Expressing it explicitly:

```prolog
{ match(E, P, W) : price(P), wood_type(W) }=1 :- employee(E).
```

---

## Problem 2

### Task 1: Rules for constants

```prolog
person("Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete").
job("chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer").     
grade_level(9).
```

### Task 2: For predicate "holds_job(Person, Job)" expressed as:

Each person holds exactly two jobs.

```prolog
{ holds_job(P, J) : job(J) } = 2 :- person(P).
```

Since the problem states each person holds exactly two jobs, this constraint encodes that.

---

### Additional predicate for grade level:

```prolog
has_grade(P, G) :- person(P), grade_level(G).
```

This is to represent that a person has a grade level, e.g.,

```prolog
has_grade("Pete", 9).
```

This fact can be asserted separately.

---

# **Summary - Final ASP code snippet:**

```prolog
% Problem 1: Constants
employee("Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha").
price(225; 275; 325).
wood_type("ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood").

% Problem 1: Matching each employee to exactly one price and wood type combination
{ match(E, P, W) : price(P), wood_type(W) } = 1 :- employee(E).

% --------------------------------------------------

% Problem 2: Constants
person("Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete").
job("chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer").     
grade_level(9).

% Problem 2: Each person holds exactly two jobs
{ holds_job(P, J) : job(J) } = 2 :- person(P).

% Associate grade level (only Pete has grade level 9 in this problem)
has_grade(P, G) :- person(P), grade_level(G).

% Fact representing Pete's grade level
has_grade("Pete", 9).
```

% 2. Bonita's piece costs $325.
P = 325 :- match(E,P,W), E = "Bonita".

% 3. The item made of poplar costs more than Yvette's piece.
P1 > P2 :- match(E1,P1,W1), match(E2,P2,W2), W1 = "poplar", E2 = "Yvette".

% 4. Tabitha's item costs 50 dollars less than the piece made of sandalwood.
P1 = P2 - 50 :- match(E1,P1,W1), match(E2,P2,W2), E1 = "Tabitha", W2 = "sandalwood".

% 5. The $275 item is either the piece made of ash or Yvette's item.
{ W = "ash"; E = "Yvette" } = 1 :- match(E,P,W), P = 275.
```

**Constants:**
- country: "Argentina"; "Bolivia"; "Grenada"; "Oman"
- silver_medals: 2; 6; 10; 11
- gold_medals: 1; 2; 3; 4

**Predicate:**
- `assign(C, S, G)`
  where C∈country, S∈silver_medals, G∈gold_medals

**Constraints:**

```prolog

%    the team that won 6 silver medals, and the team from Argentina.
{ C = "Bolivia"; G = 3; S = 6; C = "Argentina" } = 1 :- assign(C,S,G).

% 3. The team from Oman and the team that won 10 silver medals are different.
C1 != C2 :- assign(C1,S1,G1), assign(C2,S2,G2), C1 = "Oman", S2 = 10.

% 4. The team from Oman finished with 2 gold or 1 gold medal.
{ G = 2; G = 1 } = 1 :- assign(C,S,G), C = "Oman".

% 5. The squad with 3 gold medals, the squad with 6 silver medals, and the squad from Bolivia are all different teams.
C1 != C2 :- assign(C1,S1,G1), assign(C2,S2,G2), assign(C3,S3,G3), G1=3, S2=6, C3="Bolivia".
C2 != C3 :- assign(C1,S1,G1), assign(C2,S2,G2), assign(C3,S3,G3), G1=3, S2=6, C3="Bolivia".

## Problem 3 (Jobs Held by People)

**Constants:**
- person: "Roberta"; "Thelma"; "Steve"; "Pete"
- job: "chef"; "guard"; "nurse"; "telephone operator"; "police officer"; "teacher"; "actor"; "boxer"    
- grade_level: 9

**Predicates:**

```prolog
% Person holds Job
holds_job(P, J)
% P ∈ person
% J ∈ job

% Person has Grade Level
has_grade(P, G)
% P ∈ person
% G ∈ grade_level
```

**Typical constraints (expressible using holds_job and has_grade)**:

- Each person holds exactly two jobs.

- The job of nurse is held by a male person (can be encoded via gender predicates or assumptions based on constants).

- The husband of the chef is the telephone operator (implying gender relations).

- Roberta is not a boxer.

- Pete has no education past 9th grade: `has_grade("Pete", 9).`

- Roberta, the chef, and the police officer are different people.

- Assign gender where known: Roberta and Thelma are female; Steve and Pete are male; the actor is male. 

- No job assigned to more than one person.
