The main relation is who holds which jobs (each person holds exactly two jobs).\n2. Grade_level is only mentioned directly relating to Pete's education level (has no education past 9th grade).\n3. We want to represent these facts:\n\n- Assign jobs to persons (person, job).\n- Represent relation of person to grade_level (particularly for Pete).\n- Possibly represent relationships among jobs or among persons if needed, but here problem only asks for who holds which jobs.\n\n---\n\n### Minimal predicates\n\n- To assign jobs to persons: `holds_job(Person, Job)` where `Person` in person, `Job` in job.\n  \n  This predicate defines the main relation: who has which jobs.\n\n- To restrict or mark grade level of a particular person (Pete), we can have predicate:\n\n  `has_grade(Person, Grade)` where `Person` in person, `Grade` in grade_level.\n\n  This allows stating: \"Pete has no education past the ninth grade\" as `has_grade(\"Pete\", 9).`\n\n---\n\n### Are more predicates needed?\n\nNo other categories are listed that require relations. Constraints about spouse, gender, golfing, etc. are logical clues but do not add extra constant categories. These can be handled inside the constraints of a logic solver or programming environment.\n\n---\n\n### Final predicate set\n\n1. `holds_job(Person, Job)`  \n   - Person ∈ {Roberta, Thelma, Steve, Pete}  \n   - Job ∈ {chef, guard, nurse, telephone operator, police officer, teacher, actor, boxer}\n\n2. `has_grade(Person, Grade)`  \n   - Person ∈ {Roberta, Thelma, Steve, Pete}  \n   - Grade ∈ {9}\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- These predicates cover all categories.\n- Minimum number of predicates is **2**.\n- Each predicate relates variables from different constant categories.\n- Variables are assumed distinct and their categories specified as per constants.\n\n---\n\n### Output:\n\n```prolog\n% Predicates:\n\n% Person holds Job\nholds_job(Person, Job)  \n% Person has Grade\nhas_grade(Person, Grade)\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you want the corresponding variables explicitly:\n\n```prolog\nholds_job(P, J)\n  % P belongs to person\n  % J belongs to job\n\nhas_grade(P, G)\n  % P belongs to person\n  % G belongs to grade_level\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want the predicates for the earlier problems or any further elaboration!",
