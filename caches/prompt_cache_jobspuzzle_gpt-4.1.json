Every solution (assignment of people to jobs) is an instance of this predicate.\n\n### Final Output\n\n**Predicates:**\n```prolog\n% The categories in Constants are person and job. We use different variables P (person) and J (job).\n% We assign a person P to hold a job J, where P belongs to person and J belongs to job.\nholds(P, J)\n```\n\nThis is the **minimum** (single) predicate needed to define the required relations between the available categories.\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| Problem | Categories                          | Minimum predicates |\n|:--------|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------|\n| 1       | index_of_row, index_of_column       | assign(Ir, Ic)    |\n| 2       | employee, price, wood_type          | match(E, P, W)    |\n| 3       | person, job                         | holds(P, J)       |",
